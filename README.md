# Dahlia

Dahlia is a simple text formatting package, inspired by text formatting in the game Minecraft.

Text is formatted in a similar way to in the game. With Dahlia, it is formatted by typing a special character `&` followed by a format code and finally the text to be formatted.

## Installation

Dahlia is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip, or any other Python package manager:

```
$ pip install dahlia
```
(Some systems may require you to use `pip3`, `python -m pip`, or `py -m pip` instead)
